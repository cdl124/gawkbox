# Gawkbox Assignment

For this assignment, I have designed a simple journal app with login/signup capabilities. The homepage is accessible only when logged in, and contains information specific to the user (in this case, journal entries). The user will be able to log out as well.

The app is called HighFive, and is meant to record personal daily achievements. More info to come soon.

*HighFive!*
